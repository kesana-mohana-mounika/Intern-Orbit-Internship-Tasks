# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Rating Prediction using Machine Learning

## ðŸ“Œ Prompt

**Develop a predictive model to estimate movie ratings based on genre, director, and actors.**

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal

The aim of this project is to build a machine learning regression model that accurately predicts **IMDb ratings** based on various features of movies such as:
- Genre
- Director
- Actors
- Year of release
- Duration
- Number of votes

This project enables a deeper understanding of the **factors influencing movie ratings** and provides a predictive tool for estimating ratings of new or upcoming movies.

## ðŸ”§ Project Steps

### 1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Removed duplicates and null values
- Converted string values (e.g., `"120 min"`) to integers
- Handled multiple genres per movie using `.explode()`
- Filtered top 10 directors; others marked as "Other"
- Applied one-hot encoding to categorical features

### 2. Feature Selection
- Removed non-contributing features like `Name`
- Used: `Year`, `Duration`, `Votes`, `Genre`, `Director`

### 3. Model Building
- Split the data into training and testing sets (80-20)
- Used **Random Forest Regressor** with 100 trees
- Trained on encoded and aligned features

### 4. Model Evaluation
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** ~0.42  
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** ~0.43  
- **RÂ² Score:** 0.771  
> A strong performance indicating the model captures key predictive signals.
